This one was awesome but so satisfying

`gdb -q /bin/getflag`

*1h30 of tests etc.*

set 3 breakpoints :
_ 'main+72' (ptrace check)
_ 'main+391' (idk)
_ 'main+444' (getuid to return the right flag)

Now we need to edit the registers:
1) `set $eax=1`
2) `set $eax=1`
2) `set $eax=0xbc6` (3014 = uid of flag14)
